  <h1 class = "regHeader flame" >What can I do as a moderator?</h1>

<ul>
  <li> Set the settings/rules </li>
  <li> Remove players  </li>
  <li> Start or cancel the game (in setup phase) </li>
  <li> Complete a player’s kill</li>
  <li> Reverse a player’s death </li>
  <li> Manage disputes over whether a kill is valid</li>
</ul>
  <br>
  <h1 class = "regHeader flame" >How do I set the rules? </h1>
  <br>
  At the start of the game, you will be prompted to set the rules. You can also click the “change settings” button on the game page. You can hover over the information boxes to see what a rule means. Although there is a lot of freedom for the rules you can choose, the default settings are recommended if you are new as they are proven to be fun!
  <br>
  <h1 class = "regHeader flame" >How do I manage a dispute? </h1>
  <br>
  The best way to manage a dispute is to look at the facts objectively and compare them to the ruleset. Never make a decision off of personal bias towards or against, as it will make you less credible as a moderator and overall hurt the amount of fun everybody has within the game. After you reviewed the facts objectively, choose to either complete the kill / reverse the death / do nothing based on which scenario is most likely to fit with the ruleset.
  <br>
  <h1 class = "regHeader flame" >  How can I complete a player’s kill? </h1>
  <br>
  Once the game is live, you can simply click the [Complete Assignment] button next to the player’s assignment. The assassinated player’s target will now go to the player who had the assassinated player as their target.
  <br>
  <h1 class = "regHeader flame" >How can I reverse a player’s death? </h1>
  <br>
  Once the game is live, and if the player is dead, you can simply click the [Reverse Death] button next to the player’s assignment.
  <br>
<h1 class = "regHeader flame" >  How do I start the game? </h1>
  <br>
  If the game is in setup mode, and you have more than 2 players, simply press the “start game” button and the game will move to live mode.
